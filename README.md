Easy NOMP Pubkey generator
=====================

** DON'T USE THIS YET, IT HASN'T BEEN TESTED CORRECTLY **

Pubkey generator for NOMP pools, to anonymously mine in merged pools.

Just run gen_pubkey_nomp.py with Python 2.7 and follow the instructions on the console.

Generates addresses for:

 * Blakecoin
 * Photon
 * Electron
 * Dirac
 * BlakeBitcoin
 * UniversalMolecule
 
More to come later.
 
Includes a modified version of Pycoin that allows (rather partial) usage with a lot of altcoins.
 
Enjoy!
